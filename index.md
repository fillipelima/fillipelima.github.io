Hi,

I'm Fillipe, a passionate and curious software developer. I have been working on web applications over 12 years. Lived 1 year in Toronto (Canada) to study English.

Even though most of the time I use Java, Iâ€™m willing to develop and delivery code in any language / framework needed. I think the good programmer can code in any language, it's just a matter of syntax that can be grasped quickly. What really matters is how the developer thinks and can approach problems, using strong knowledge in Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, for example.

I worked as a programmer, PL/SQL developer for Oracle DB, Software Architect, Data administrator, Change and Configuration Manager and Team Lead.

Used Core Java, Java EE, JSP, JSF, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, EJB, Struts, Hibernate, EclipseLink, Spring, UML.

Oracle DB, SQLServer, PostgreSQL

Weblogic, OC4J, JBOSS, Tomcat.

Eclipse, Jbuilder, Oracle Designer.

CVS, IBM Rational Clearcase, Borland StarTeam, GIT, Jenkins, Hudson, Sonar, Nexus, Ant, Maven.

Windows / Linux (Ubuntu)
