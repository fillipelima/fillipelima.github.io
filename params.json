Lived 1 year in Toronto (Canada) to study English.\r\n\r\nEven though most of the time I use Java, Iâ€™m willing to develop and delivery code in any language / framework needed. I think the good programmer can code in any language, it's just a matter of syntax that can be grasped quickly. What really matters is how the developer thinks and can approach problems, using strong knowledge in Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, for example.\r\n\r\nI worked as a programmer, PL/SQL developer for Oracle DB, Software Architect, Data administrator, Change and Configuration Manager and Team Leader.\r\n\r\nUsed Core Java, Java EE, JSP, JSF, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, EJB, Struts, Hibernate, EclipseLink, UML.\r\n\r\nOracle DB, SQLServer, PostgreSQL\r\n\r\nWeblogic, JBOSS, Tomcat\r\n\r\nEclipse, Jbuilder, Oracle Designer.\r\n\r\nCVS, IBM Rational Clearcase, Borland StarTeam, GIT\r\n\r\nWindows / Linux (Ubuntu)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fillipe)\r\n\r\n[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/6334354/fillipe-lima?tab=profile)\r\n\r\n[Github](https://github.com/fillipelima)\r\n\r\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/folima)\r\n\r\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fillipeolima)\r\n\r\nSkype: fillipelima\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
