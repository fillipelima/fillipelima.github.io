I'm a passionate and curious software developer and have been working on web applications over 12 years.\r\n\r\nFrom 2007 to 2008 I Lived 1 year in Toronto - Canada in order to study English. Love that language, by the way.\r\n\r\nEven though most of the time I use Java, Iâ€™m willing to develop and delivery code in any language / framework needed. I think the good programmer can code in any language, it's just a matter of syntax that can be grasped quickly. What really matters is how the developer thinks and how he/she can approach problems, using his/her strong knowledment in Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, for example.\r\n\r\nI worked as a programmer, PL/SQL developer for Oracle DB, Software Architect, Data administrator, Change and Configuration Manager and Team Leader.\r\n\r\nUsed Core Java, Java EE, JSP, JSF, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, EJB, Struts, Hibernate, EclipseLink, UML.\r\n\r\nOracle DB, SQLServer, PostgreSQL\r\n\r\nWeblogic, JBOSS, Tomcat\r\n\r\nEclipse, Jbuilder, Oracle Designer.\r\n\r\nCVS, IBM Rational Clearcase, Borland StarTeam, GIT\r\n\r\nWindows / Linux (Ubuntu)\r\n",
